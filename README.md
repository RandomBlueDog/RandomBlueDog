- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RandomBlueDog
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things Furry and IT stuff (especially networking and hardware stuff - as long as it doesn't catch on fire! o.o )
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and CSS, as well as some Java and SQL Basics!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: A surprising number of Furries work in server rooms or data centers. Is it because data centers are cold, and fursuits keep you warm? Maybe. Is it because we love blinking lights and solving problems? Absolutely.
